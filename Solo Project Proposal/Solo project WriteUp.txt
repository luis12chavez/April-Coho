Solo project proposal, custom wireframe made in Balsamiq, and I based my wireframe from the iSport module.

Description:
My idea was similar to iSport in that my project would be more focused for car enthusiasts adding locations for backroad/hill runs and where my wireframe is referred to.  

Stack Focus: 
JavaScript/Mern

GitHub:

CRUD Functionality:
User can create own profile
User will be able to view all the locations that others have posted for recommendations
User can select locations link to view more details
User can create own recommendations
User will be able to edit/update and delete own posts

Validations:
When user creates own account, uploads, and edits own upload
There will be requirements for inputs and errors for the appropriate inputs
